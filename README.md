# Std3DMath

Standard math for 3D rendering (C++).

- Aligned with Intel SIMD primitives for practical convenience (Vector3, Vector4).
- Not very complete nor intended to be; I add & refactor by demand.
- Resides in global namespace (change if necessary).
- All angles are in radians (unless explicitly stated otherwise).
- Library uses standard assert() where necessary.
